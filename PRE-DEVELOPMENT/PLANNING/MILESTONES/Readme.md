>____Define the chatbot goal or goals____

You need to understand the reason for implementing a chatbot. Stop for a second and ask yourself two questions: 

“Which problem would the chatbot solve?”

“What will exactly a chatbot be doing?”

We’ll start by defining the main customer intents when contacting your customer service.

To do so, we create categories with the most popular customer requests on the same topic.

>Define areas that the chatbot can take ove

You can assess processes based on:

Ease – how easy do you think it will be to automate these customer requests?

Importance– how important for you to automate these customer requests?

Time – how much time do you think this will take to automate?

Impact – what impact will it have on your business/customer service if you automate this category with customer requests?

But, you can choose other metrics that are important to you.

So, the “Banking status check” gets 18 points.
Do this with every process on your list and then choose for automation those with the highest scores.
