AI-Powered Virtual Assistants in the Realms of Banking and Financial Services

1. Introduction
Remarkable improvements in computer and telecommunication technology have fueled financial innovation worldwide in the last few decades and are key to most developments under way, that encompass institutional, product and process innovations: they deal with new types of financial firms (such as specialist credit card companies, electronic trading platforms and direct banks), new financial services (such as derivatives, asset-backed securities and foreign currency mortgages) and new ways of doing financial business (such as virtual, home and phone banking); in other words, all three pillars that the financial system is generally thought of being based on – namely: financial institutions, markets and products – have been positively affected, to the point that “many of the things that seemed so incredible 10 years ago are now foundational” [1]. Looking forward, the incredible pace of technology-driven change sounds promising for further progress, that may prove beneficial non only to financial institutions, but also to their counterparts across all economic sectors and geographical areas.
Within this framework, a major role needs to be assigned to artificial intelligence (AI), as a “multidisciplinary topic, where researches from multiple fields as neuroscience, computing science, cognitive sciences, exact sciences and different engineering areas converge” [2]. Related applications have gained momentum in the realms of banking and financial services, as well as in other industries, thus leading to state that getting involved in AI is a must, rather than just an option: reference points can be easily identified with “machines or systems that can perform complex tasks normally considered to require ‘intelligence’ and thus thought to be the preserve of humans” while the meaning of AI has been explained by evoking “a computer system that can sense, comprehend, act and learn”; as a result, it can be argued that “by enabling machines to interact more naturally – with their environment, with people and with data – the technology can extend the capabilities of both humans and machines far beyond what each can do on their own” [3], p. 3.
These thoughts pave the way for emphasizing the cross-cultural implications of AI, with its specific challenges and opportunities, and for discussing about it in terms of “systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience” [4]. Along this line of analysis, it comes natural to sort out most recent trends in this field, which sounds like an invitation to shed special light on AI-powered virtual assistants: they tend to be perceived as innovative tools that can help financial institutions and especially banks – as well as other enterprises – to provide customer service support and carry out administrative tasks, though the pertaining scope seems much wider; therefore, it is worth investigating how these digital assistants can be usefully resorted to and fully exploiting their potential, in sight of contributing to advances in the financial industry and particularly in the banking sector, due to its relevance and even prominence in many operating areas.


2. From “bricks” to “clicks”
To begin with, it must be accounted for the significant improvements in information technology that have been translated into new means of making banking and financial services available, including delivering them electronically: no surprise that e-finance has increasingly expanded, at a relatively fast pace, as financial institutions have quickly perceived the risk of becoming obsolete if this evolving trend would not be endorsed; a case in point has to do with the automated teller machine (ATM), that stands as a major form of an e-banking facility and that has enabled customers to get cash, make deposits, transfer funds from one account to another and perform other financial transactions all day long, without interacting with a human being. Not only the adoption of this facility has contributed to keep operating costs at relatively modest levels for banks, but more convenience has been provided to their customers.
Meanwhile, the drop in the cost of telecommunications has encouraged these financial intermediaries to develop other innovations, such as those that fall under the umbrella of home banking: it allows banks’ customers to conduct many of their bank transactions without even leaving the comfort of home; in turn, banks have reaped benefits that stem from bearing substantially lower transaction costs compared to those implied by having customers come to their premises. The success of ATMs has been acting as a catalyst for the introduction and spread of other innovative facilities, including the automated banking machine, which can be described as a combination in one location of an ATM, an Internet connection to the bank’s website and a telephone link to customer service [5], p. 500.
Further innovations in the financial industry – and notably in the home banking area – have been stimulated by the decline in the price of personal computers and the increase in their presence in households, thus laying the foundations for the virtual bank (also called digital-only and online-only bank) as a new type of banking institution: it delivers its services through the Internet or other forms of electronic channels – instead of conventional branches – and merely exists in cyberspace, which takes home banking one step further by enabling customers to have a full set of banking services available at home 24 hours a day; accordingly, the need for a physical location as the main vehicle to handle financial transactions has started to fade away – up to the point that many actual and potential bank customers do not even feel this need any more – and “clicks” have begun to replace “bricks” thanks to this evolutionary business model in the banking industry. However, pure Internet banks can hardly be conceived as the wave of the future, with a combination of “clicks” and “bricks” being expected to establish itself as the predominant format in the banking sector, whereby remote banking can usefully complement the banking services provided in line with traditional standards.


3. Progress in financial technology
Focusing on astonishing developments that have been recorded in financial technology – shortly fintech, a combination of finance and technology – proves rewarding to draw an updated picture of the global financial system, to be acknowledged as the largest industry in the world: as widespread evidence implies, most recent advances in this context have allowed financial institutions to satisfy the needs of their target markets in novel ways, that have shaken up the historically change-resistant banking sector, beyond expectations, and to serve potential customers that would otherwise populate the market segments consisting of the unbanked and underbanked [6]; thanks to progress in fintech, the financial industry has been experimenting with virtual banking, as well as – in more general terms – with automation, predictive analytics, new delivery platforms, blockchain and distributed ledger technology, to mention just a few innovations in the field under scrutiny. Promising areas that still call for keen attention involve mobile payments, digital currencies, peer-to-peer lending and marketplace lending, and underlying issues need to be more carefully addressed, that deal with the “the use of new technologies to solve regulatory and compliance requirements more effectively and efficiently” [7], p. 2 (or regtech) and with the recourse to innovative technology by supervisory agencies to support their activity (or suptech) [8].
As far as key players, most fintech innovations have been generated – and further fintech innovative solutions can be expected to emerge – outside the conventional financial and banking system. New applications developed by bright minds have been largely driven by non-bank entities, including venture capital-backed fintech start-ups and non-traditional providers of financial services that often focus their operations narrowly on a subset of the financial sphere of the economy: success stories abound in the area of digital payments, as fintech start-up companies have provided quick and convenient payment options, that encompass the adoption of e-wallets; they have been increasingly used for paying online purchases and for making person-to-person payments, thanks to intrinsic simplicity, not to mention strategies that have been designed to attract users by providing reward points, cash back and other exciting offers
Very smart solutions that have been recently developed include those based on biometric sensors: their installation entails another step in the ATM innovation, as they are set to replace the need for carrying plastic cards and for remembering the pin to get access to a bank account through the facility at issue; biometric ATMs use palm or fingerprint sensors, eye recognition and integrated mobile applications to identify the account holder, thus eliminating mistakes in recognizing authorized customers and granting them access even if their card has been lost. Challenges ahead encompass voice biometrics, that has already unveiled its multi-faceted advantages for financial institutions and their counterparts on a significant scale, and behavioral biometrics, that allows banks to look at how consumers behave (for instance, on a mobile app or website) rather than using physiological characteristics, like fingerprints.


4. Financial institutions and AI
With fintech being more and more widely adopted, a major impact in the financial sector has been generated by leveraging some of the latest innovations that involve AI: financial institutions have started to resort to it in order to transform the customer experience by enabling frictionless, 24/7 customer interactions while saving on costs; certain AI use cases have been increasingly disseminated within the financial industry, especially by banks, that are estimated to be offered the greater cost saving opportunities by front- and middle-office applications. A case in point has to do with the recourse to chatbots that have been used for a while, not only in the banking industry, and that allow to conduct an online chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, as a cost-effective alternative to direct contact with a live human agent.
Unquestionably, AI has the potential to upgrade bank management by making operations and processes faster and safer, with their efficiency set to increase as a result, which leads to consider the “intelligent” bank as a reliable candidate to become the rule – rather than remaining the exception – sooner than expected. Further progress can be foreseen in the financial industry, as AI applications are not just limited to retail banking: not only they are set to positively impact every office at banks, but these applications can support all financial services providers to completely redefine how they work, how they deliver innovative services and how they transform customer experiences; to stress this point, even though consideration tends to be focused on front-office operations, the back- and middle- offices of investment banks and other financial institutions can also benefit from AI, as shown by the full range of channels to get usefully involved in this innovative wave, encompassing front-office (conversational banking), middle-office (anti-fraud) and back-office (underwriting).
While the number of financial institutions that avail themselves of AI technology is on the rise, the ones that will achieve successful implementation are those that can develop comprehensive strategies: they can help to sense, comprehend, act and learn, therefore envisaging a system that can perceive the world around it, analyze and understand the information it receives, take actions based on that understanding and improve its own performance by learning from what happened; these strategies can help to drive growth in banking and financial services, in sight of a more sustainable and inclusive financial system, which our global village needs and deserves, now more than even, due to the troublesome and persisting effects of the Covid-19 health emergency. It is noticeable that several trends in digital engagement have accelerated during this pandemic and the gloomy picture to be confronted with should push financial institutions to take advantage of AI technology as “the foundation for new value propositions and distinctive customer experiences”, to compete successfully and thrive [9].


5. Focus on virtual assistants
Virtual assistants can be considered the most conspicuous way in which AI has modernized so far – and can still upgrade – the financial system, adding to the human version of these assistants: as shown by the more and more intensive reliance on chatbots, they have attracted the attention of financial institutions, as well as of firms across a wide range of other economic sectors, and are being viewed as a key ingredient to create differentiation in today’s increasingly crowded landscape; the underlying technology includes application programming interfaces that allow to analyze data, as well as web- and mobile-based user interfaces, and to deliver the necessary insights to the end customer. No wonder that forward-looking financial institutions have taken a leap of faith by investing in digital assistants to make “contextual insights” available to the right persons at the right time and through the preferred channels [10].
AI makes a huge difference between chatbots and virtual assistants who are typically self-employed workers specialized in providing administrative services to clients while operating outside their offices: these independent contractors usually work from a home office; access is granted to them to the necessary documents remotely, which acts as a stimulus to explore the potential of these assistants in the post-pandemic scenario. Since working from home has become more accepted for both workers and employers, the demand for skilled virtual assistants can be assumed to grow and new opportunities are surfacing for virtual assistants who are skilled in social media, content management, graphic design, blog writing, bookkeeping and web marketing [11].
To make a long story short, one of the advantages of hiring a virtual assistant is the flexibility to contract for just the services that each employer needs. Actually, this type of worker has become prominent, as small businesses and start-ups have embraced the trend to rely on virtual offices to keep costs low and firms of all sizes keep increasing their use of the Internet for their daily operations: being virtual assistants classified as self-employed workers, a company willing to take advantage of their services would not have to grant the same benefits it would be requested to provide its employees with; furthermore, since virtual assistants work offsite, they are expected to arrange and pay for their own toolkit (for instance, computer equipment, high-speed Internet connection and commonly used software programs) and it should not even be accounted for workspace, including a desk, at the company’s office.
